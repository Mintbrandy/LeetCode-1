Easy - 342. Power of Four

<!--more-->

## 题目

Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

**Example:**
Given num = 16, return true. Given num = 5, return false.

**Follow up**: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## 解析

参考 `Easy - 231. Power of Two` 和 `Easy - 326. Power of Three` 

## 代码

``` java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
        return num > 0 && (num&(num-1)) == 0 && (num & 0x55555555) != 0;
        //0x55555555 is to get rid of those power of 2 but not power of 4
        //so that the single 1 bit always appears at the odd position 
    }
}
```
