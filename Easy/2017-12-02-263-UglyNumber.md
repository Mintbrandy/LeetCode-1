Easy - 263. Ugly Number

<!--more-->

## 题目

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. For example, `6, 8` are ugly while `14` is not ugly since it includes another prime factor `7`.

Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.

## 解析

判断一个数的素数因子是否只含有`2, 3, 5`

## 代码

``` java
class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int num) {
        if (num > 0) {
            for (int i : new int[]{2, 3, 5}) {
                while (num % i == 0) {
                    num /= i;
                }
            }
        }
        return num == 1;
    }
}
```
